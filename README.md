## What is LiveArch?

LiveArch is a developer tool that watches your project files and automatically generates a **live, interactive architecture diagram** saved as `.visualarch.html` inside your repo.

Every time you save a file — add a component, install a package, create a route — the diagram updates in under half a second. No manual input. No paste. No describe. It just watches and draws.

```
You save a file in your editor
        ↓
LiveArch detects the change (350ms debounce)
        ↓
Re-analyses your entire repo
        ↓
Rewrites .visualarch.html on disk
        ↓
Pushes update via WebSocket to your open browser
        ↓
Diagram updates live — new nodes flash green ✅
```

## Demo

> 🎬 A recorded GIF demo is coming soon (see [`docs/`](docs/)). In the meantime, try it yourself in under a minute:

```bash
npx livearch            # in any JS/TS project
# open the printed http://localhost:7842 in your browser
# save any file — watch the diagram update instantly
```

Open `.visualarch.html` in your browser. Run `livearch` in your terminal. Now save any file — watch the diagram update instantly: new nodes flash green and a toast shows the changed file.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally (once)
npm install -g livearch

# Go to any project
cd my-project

# Start watching
livearch

# Output:
#   ⬡  LiveArch
#   ─────────────────────────────────────────
#   📁 Watching  : /Users/you/my-project
#   📄 Diagram   : .visualarch.html  ← open this in your browser
#   🌐 Live URL  : http://localhost:7842
#   ─────────────────────────────────────────
#   ✓ 27 nodes detected, 30 files watched
#
#   Diagram auto-updates every time you save a file.
#   Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

Open `.visualarch.html` in your browser. That's it.

---

## How It Works

LiveArch has three parts:

### 1. File Watcher (`bin/livearch.js`)
Uses [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) to watch every file in your project. When any file changes, it triggers a rebuild with a 350ms debounce — so rapid saves don't cause flicker.

### 2. Analyser (`lib/analyser.js`)
Reads your project and detects:
- **Tech stack** from `package.json` — React, Vue, Express, Prisma, Redis, Stripe, etc.
- **Components** from `.jsx` / `.tsx` files — grouped by folder
- **Architecture layers** — Frontend, Backend, Data, External, Tooling
- **Edges** — logical connections between nodes (what renders what, what calls what)

### 3. Diagram Generator (`lib/template.js`)
Builds a self-contained `.visualarch.html` file with:
- Grouped layer boxes (like GitDiagram)
- Dashed curved arrows between nodes
- Click-to-inspect panel with file path and connections
- WebSocket client that reconnects to the watcher automatically

## Architecture Layers

LiveArch groups nodes into 5 layers displayed top-to-bottom:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🚀  Entry Points                   │  main.jsx, App.jsx, i18n.jsx
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ⚛   Framework                     │  React, Vue, Next.js
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🧩  Components                     │  All your UI components
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  💾  Data         🖼 Assets         │  wines.js, public/
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ⚡  Tooling                        │  Vite, npm scripts, CI/CD
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For full-stack projects, the Backend layer sits between Framework and Data:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🚀  Entry Points                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ⚛   Framework / Frontend          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🚂  Backend / API                  │  Express, routes, middleware
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  💾  Data                           │  PostgreSQL, Redis, Prisma
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🌐  External                       │  Stripe, SendGrid, AWS
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ⚙   Tooling                       │  Vite, Jest, CI/CD
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The `.visualarch.html` File

This file is generated in your project root and is fully self-contained. It:

- Works offline (no external dependencies after load)
- Connects to the watcher via WebSocket when available
- Falls back gracefully when watcher is not running (shows last known state)
- Can be committed to your repo so teammates see the architecture immediately on clone
- Can be shared as a standalone HTML file — just send the file

### Recommended: Add to `.gitignore`?

Your choice. Two valid approaches:

**Commit it** — teammates see the architecture diagram when they clone. Great for onboarding.

**Ignore it** — treat it as a build artifact. Add `.visualarch.html` to `.gitignore`.

## Interactive Features

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Click a node** | Opens detail panel — file path, type, connections |
| **Hover a node** | Tooltip with description |
| **Toggle edges** | Show/hide arrows between nodes |
| **Highlighted edges** | Select a node — only its connections light up |
| **Create GitHub issue** | In the AI Review panel, turn any suggestion into a prefilled GitHub issue in one click |
| **Export PNG / SVG** | Download the whole diagram as an image for docs or slides |
| **New node flash** | Green flash when a new node is detected |
| **Scroll + resize** | Arrows redraw to stay accurate |

---

## Supported Project Types

LiveArch works with any JavaScript/TypeScript project. It is especially good with:

- React + Vite apps
- Next.js apps
- Vue / Nuxt apps
- Express / Fastify APIs
- Full-stack monorepos (frontend + backend in one repo)
- Any project with a `package.json`
- **Python** (`requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py`) — FastAPI, Django, Flask, SQLAlchemy, …
- **Go** (`go.mod`) — Gin, Echo, Fiber, chi, GORM, gRPC, …
- **Rust** (`Cargo.toml`) — Actix, Axum, Rocket, Tokio, Diesel, SQLx, …

More languages are planned — see [Roadmap](#roadmap).

  }
}
```

Run with:
```bash
npm run arch
```

### npx (no install)
```bash
npx livearch
```

---

## Commands

LiveArch has one default command (watch) plus a few subcommands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `livearch [path]` | Watch a project, serve the live diagram, and auto-open it in your browser |
| `livearch [path] --no-watch` | Generate `.visualarch.html` once and exit (CI mode) |
| `livearch [path] --review` | Print AI architecture suggestions and exit (needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) |
| `livearch diff <base-ref> [head-ref]` | Compare the architecture between two git refs |
| `livearch badge [path]` | Write an SVG architecture badge you can embed in your README |
| `livearch --help` | Show help |

### Watch (default)

```bash
livearch                          # watch current directory, opens the diagram
livearch ./frontend               # watch a subdirectory
livearch --port 8000              # use a different port
livearch --output arch.html       # custom output filename
livearch --no-open                # don't auto-open the browser
livearch --no-watch               # generate once and exit (CI)
```

### AI review (Pro) — with a free Preview

```bash
livearch --review                 # free heuristic Preview (no key needed)
livearch --review --demo          # force the Preview even if a key is set

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
livearch --review                 # full AI review powered by Claude
```

Without a key you get a free **Preview** (graph heuristics — over-connected components, missing auth/DB layers, isolated nodes). Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to unlock the full **Pro** review, which sends the graph to Claude for richer, context-aware suggestions. Click **🧠 AI Review** in the diagram (or use the VS Code extension). Override the model with `LIVEARCH_MODEL` (default `claude-opus-4-8`).

Each suggestion in the review panel has a **⤴ Create GitHub issue** button (shown when your repo has a GitHub `origin` remote). It opens a GitHub *new issue* form pre-filled with the affected component, the concern, and the suggested fix — you review and submit it yourself, so nothing is posted without your click.

### Architecture diff

```bash
livearch diff main                # compare main → your working tree
livearch diff main feature/auth   # compare two branches/refs
```

Prints added/removed nodes and connections — great for reviewing what a branch changes structurally.

### README badge

```bash
livearch badge                              # writes docs/architecture-badge.svg
livearch badge . --output docs/arch.svg     # custom path
```

Then embed it:

```markdown
![Architecture](docs/architecture-badge.svg)
```

## Options

```
Options:
  --port <number>       WebSocket/HTTP port (default: 7842)
  --host <addr>         Bind address (default: all interfaces, for team sharing)
  --output <filename>   Output filename (default: .visualarch.html)
  --ignore <glob>       Additional ignore pattern (repeatable)
  --no-open             Don't auto-open the browser
  --no-watch            Generate the diagram once and exit (CI mode)
  --routes              Include individual HTTP endpoints as nodes (off by default)
  --tests               Include test files as nodes (off by default)
  --config              Include config files (.env, …) as nodes (off by default)
  --review              Print AI architecture suggestions and exit
  --help                Show this help
```

---

## Sharing with your team

LiveArch's watcher already pushes live updates to **every** connected browser — so multiple people can watch the same diagram update in real time. There are three ways to share, from simplest to most live:

**1. Commit the diagram (works on clone, offline)**
```bash
livearch --no-watch
git add .visualarch.html && git commit -m "architecture snapshot"
```
Teammates open `.visualarch.html` after cloning — no install needed. Great for onboarding. Pair it with a badge: `livearch badge`.

**2. Same network — live**
Run the watcher and share the **Network URL** it prints:
```
👥 Network   : http://192.168.1.20:7842  ← share this with your team
```
Anyone on the same Wi-Fi/LAN who opens that URL sees the diagram update **live** as you code. (The page connects to whichever host served it, so the live link follows the URL.)

**3. Anywhere — live, via a tunnel**
Expose your local port with a tunnel and share the public URL:
```bash
livearch                       # in one terminal
ngrok http 7842                # or: cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:7842
```
Remote teammates open the tunnel URL and get real-time updates (works over HTTPS too).

**4. Permanent hosted URL (self-host the server)**
A minimal Next.js server in [`server/`](server/) gives your diagram a permanent, shareable URL that stays up even when your laptop is off — and updates **live** for everyone viewing it:
```bash
cd server && npm install && npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000

# publish once:
livearch push <handle>/<repo> --server http://localhost:3000
# …or keep it live — push on every save (viewers update in real time via SSE):
livearch share <handle>/<repo> --server http://localhost:3000
# → everyone opens http://localhost:3000/u/<handle>/<repo>

# private, owner-locked (viewers need the token):
livearch share <handle>/<repo> --token <secret> --private --server http://localhost:3000
```
This implements Phases 1–2 and the access-control part of Phase 3 of [`docs/BACKEND-DESIGN.md`](docs/BACKEND-DESIGN.md): permanent URL, live sync (SSE), and owner-locked private projects. Full OAuth accounts and a persistent multi-user datastore are the remaining hosted work.

node /path/to/livearch/bin/livearch.js
```

### Areas that need help
- More language support (Java, C#, Ruby, PHP — Python/Go/Rust already supported)
- Better import parsing to build smarter edges
- VS Code extension
- Tests
- Better CSS framework detection (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.)

## FAQ

**Does it send my code anywhere?**
No. Everything runs locally on your machine. Your code never leaves your computer. The WebSocket connection is local (`localhost:7842`).

**Does it work with monorepos?**
Yes. Run `livearch` from the root. It detects all packages.

**What if I have a huge project with thousands of files?**
LiveArch ignores `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, and `coverage` by default. For very large repos it uses a 350ms debounce so it doesn't rebuild on every keystroke.

**Can I commit `.visualarch.html`?**
Yes — this is actually recommended. Teammates who clone your repo can immediately open the diagram without running anything.

**Does it work with non-JS projects?**
Yes — JavaScript/TypeScript, **Python** (`requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml`/`setup.py`), **Go** (`go.mod`), and **Rust** (`Cargo.toml`) are all detected, including their frameworks and databases. More languages are on the roadmap.

**Can I use it in CI?**
Yes. Run `livearch --no-watch` to generate the diagram once and exit (planned for v0.2).
